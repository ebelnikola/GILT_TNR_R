    Apply a full step of Gilt-TNR to a lattice made of tensors A.
    A full step means a transformation that takes the square lattice to
    a square lattice (no 45deg tilt), and changes the lattice spacing by
    a factor of 2.

    Arguments:
    A: The tensor to be coarse-grained. No symmetries are assumed for A.
    log_fact: A scalar factor, such that A*np.exp(log_fact) is the
              physical tensor.
    pars: A dictionary of various parameters that the algorithm takes,
          see below.
    **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments may be given to override the
              parameters in pars. The original dictionary is not
              modified.

    Returns:
    A', log_fact'
    such that the coarse-grained physical tensor is A'*np.exp(log_fact').

    The Gilt-TNR algorithm takes the following parameters:
    gilt_eps:
    The threshold for how small singular values are considered "small
    enough" in Gilt, which determines the amount of truncation done.

    cg_chis:
    An iterable of integers, that lists the possible bond dimensions
    to which TRG is allowed to truncate.

    cg_eps:
    A threshold for the truncation error in TRG.
    The bond dimension used in the truncated SVD of TRG is the smallest
    one from cg_chis, such that the truncation error is below cg_eps.
    If this isn't possible, then the largest chi in cg_chis is used.
